'use strict';

//Add a console.log message in inline_js.html
// that says "Hello from inline JavaScript".

//Add a console.log message in external.js
// that says "Hello from external JavaScript".

//Use the alert function to show a message that says 'Welcome to my Website!'.
//Use a prompt to ask for the user's favorite color. Use the user's response
// to alert a message that says that the color entered is your favorite color too.

// For example, if the user enters "blue",
// your code should alert a message that says:
// "Great, blue is my favorite color too!"

// Complete exercise 3 from the previous lesson, but write your code
// in the external.js file instead of in the console.
// When the exercise asks you to use a number, instead
// use a prompt to ask the user for that number.
// Use an alert to show the results of each problem.
// Finally, commit the changes to your git repository, and push to GitHub.
